          <span>My Love,</span>
          <br />
          Since my tender days, I fantasized love to be something that was
          straight out of a fairytale. Something perfect and flawless, with
          everything going right all the time. I thought love to be butterflies
          in the stomach, romantic dinner dates, fancy gifts, flower bouquets,
          romantic conversations, & it being the solution to every problem. I
          thought true love was a perfect journey.However, the older I grew, I
          realized how flawed my notions of true love were. To me, true love is
          now about tears of happiness from laughing together and tears of
          sadness after a fight. It's about sharing ugly selfies, & enjoying
          ugly laughs. It's about staying up late even after a tiring day, just
          because you can't sleep without talking to them. It's about listening
          to each other's rants, and being honest even when it hurts. It's about
          making exceptions, watching that movie you swore you never would, or
          eating that meal you always avoided. It's about accepting each other's
          past while embracing their pain, giving them a sense of safety &
          helping them heal from it. It's about celebrating success together, &
          consoling & motivating each other through failure. It's about
          believing & bringing out the best in each other. It's about that
          feeling of jealousy at the thought of someone making them happier than
          you do. It's about that sense of peace & calm they make you feel, yet
          your heart is always racing in their presence. It's about sticking
          around when things get tough, ESPECIALLY when things get tough. It's
          about promising you'll never leave, and keeping that promise. That's
          what true love is really all about. That is what I feel with you which
          I never felt before and that makes me so sure about you.
